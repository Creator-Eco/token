# EOSIO Helpers and Scripts

- `./deployment` has our deployment scripts, which should be better documented
- `./tests` has our single test
- `./utils` has a bunch of utilities, mostly aimed at testnet (kylin) experiments

- `state.env` contains environment variables and should only be written by scripts
- `bbs.env` contains environment variables set by the user, and will always take precedence
- `env.sh` is exports our environment variables and some helper functins
